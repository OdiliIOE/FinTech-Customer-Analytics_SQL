# QUESTION 2: TRANSACTION FREQUENCY ANALYSIS

# The following was done to segment customers based on how often they performed monthly transactions using transaction data:

	# 1. Count each customer's transactions per month.
	# 2. Calculate their average monthly transactions.
	# 3. Categorize them as: High Frequency (≥10) Medium Frequency (3–9) Low Frequency (≤2)
	# 4. Include all users, even those with no transactions.
	# 5. Group results to show the number of customers and average transactions per category.
# Running the query resulted in a summary showing how active different customer groups are, thereby helping the finance team with segmentation.
