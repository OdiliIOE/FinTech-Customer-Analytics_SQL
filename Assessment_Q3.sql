# QUESTION 3: ACCOUNT INACTIVITY ALERT

# The following was done to identify inactive accounts:
  # 1. Selected all active savings and investment plans.
  # 2. Found the latest successful inflow (deposit) date for each plan.
  # 3. Joined the two to match each plan with its last inflow.
  # 4. Filtered for plans with no inflow in over 1 year (or no inflow at all).
# The resulting query gives a list of plans that have been inactive for over 1 year (365 days).
